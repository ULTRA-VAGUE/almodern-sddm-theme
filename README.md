# üé® ALmodern SDDM | Dynamic Video Backgrounds and Built in Video Swicher! 
A Modern Theme following apple's design philosophy with a üî• twist.
The **ALmodern SDDM Theme**  allows you to play your chosen videos randomly, utilizing different playlists based on the time of day.
The theme differentiates between day and night, where night is defined as the period between **7 PM and 7 AM** (configured in 24-hour format).
It is possible to tweak the settings for more time differentiation.
