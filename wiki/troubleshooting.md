## Troubleshooting Stutters: Videos Not Loading Correctly When Pressing the SFW|NSFW Switch

Occasionally, the video synchronization function may cause videos to restart repeatedly, effectively looping them. To resolve this issue, try clicking the SFW|NSFW switch a few times.

Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t find a workaround due to limitations in the Qt libraries regarding synchronization across multiple monitors. If you have suggestions or solutions to mitigate this problem, please feel free to contribute!
