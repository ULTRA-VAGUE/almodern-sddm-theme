### Installing Background Videos



1. Use high-quality sources like [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) or download videos using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

2. Move the downloaded videos to:
```bash
   /home/YOUR_USER/Videos/
```
3. Install the Provided Apple Fonts from within the Folder or provide your own Font Family in **theme.conf.user**

4. Modify **playlistcreator.sh**:

   4.1 Open playlistcreator.sh with a text editor and edit **YOUR-USER**

   4.2 Run playlistcreator.sh *(ensure you donâ€™t have any unwanted videos in the Video Folder beforehand)*

   4.3 Name the playlist files according to the naming convention:
       **day** | **night** | **daynsfw** | **nightnsfw**

#### you can edit the playlist.m3u files with any text editor you like, and add videos by pasting their path on a new line. e.g
```bash
file:///usr/share/sddm/themes/ALmodern/example_daytime.webm
file:///usr/share/sddm/themes/ALmodern/another_example_4_daytime.webm
```       

### :white_check_mark: Completed

Once completed, the playlistcreator should move your downloaded videos into the theme folder, create playlists based on the number of videos in the Video folder, and leave you satisfied! ðŸ˜Š
